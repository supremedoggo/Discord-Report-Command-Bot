# Discord-Report-Command-Bot
A simple bot that takes a $report command and creates a trial with a Judge, Jury, and Officers.

This bot, known as "PoliceBot" on my Discord server, uses a simple report function ($report), in the format $report [username of criminal] [rule broken]. An example would be $report @supremerdoggo 1. This would report @supremerdoggo for breaking rule 1.
Reporting someone creates a private channel on the server with the format "#trial-[integer]", examples being #trial-0 or trial-1.

Please note that this bot requires roles "Judge", "Jury", and "Officer" to function. The Judge and Jury roles are rather self-explanatory, but the "Officer" role is meant to be used for the bot, with the extra permission Manage Channels, along with the default permissions.
The bot also uses a rules list. If you wish to use this bot on your own server and you happen to have a different set of rules there, it would be best to fork it and change the rules list to your server's own list.
This bot is part of a Discord application named "Bots". The application may contain multiple bots at the time of integration with your server.
These bots may not be active/online at certain times.
